# HicEtNunc-iframe-Auction
An experimental project to run actions on HicEtNunc (a temporary hack)

Important:
- This is a temporary hack to setup an auction on hicetnunc.
- It is not secured, and it is currently possible to force wrong bids, please use accordingly.
- You need basic dev skills to setup this code (html, javascript, css, json and php).
- You need to host these files on a server that runs php.
- Unfortunately I can not provide support for this code.
